### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies

Laravel utilizes [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. First, download a copy of the composer.phar.
Once you have the PHAR archive, you can either keep it in your local project directory or move to
usr/local/bin to use it globally on your system.
On Windows, you can use the Composer [Windows installer](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe).

Then run:

    composer dump-autoload
    composer install --no-scripts

### Step 3: Create database

If you finished first three steps, now you can create database on your database server(MySQL). You must create database
with utf-8 collation(uft8_general_ci), to install and application work perfectly.
After that, copy .env.example and rename it as .env and put connection and change default database connection name, only database connection, put name database, database username and password.

### Step 4: Install

Firstable need to uncomment this line "extension=php_fileinfo.dll" in php.ini file.

This project makes use of Bower and Laravel Elixir. Before triggering Elixir, you must first ensure that Node.js (included in homestead) is installed on your machine.

    node -v

Install dependencies listed in package.json with:

    npm install --save-dev

Retrieve frontend dependencies with Bower, compile SASS, and move frontend files into place:

    gulp

Now that you have the environment configured, you need to create a database configuration for it. For create database tables use this command:

    php artisan migrate

And to initial populate database use this:

    php artisan db:seed

If you install on your localhost in folder laravel5startersite, you can type on web browser:

	http://localhost/events/public
